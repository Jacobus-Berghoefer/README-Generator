#README Generator

##Motivation
To utilize a readme template that included key points for a readme, each time a project is started.

##Why this project was built
To have consistent and effective README's for all my projects.

##Problem this project solves
Sloppy and inconsistent README's

##What was learned
I Learned how to utilize inquirer, so I can setup a list of questions in an array as objects. Then pull those objects out, and reference their parameters to have user created content for the README.

##What makes this project unique
This project references what makes a professional README on the full-stack blog: https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/github/professional-readme-guide
